            <p>
                The Department Convocation marks a cherished milestone in the academic journeys of students, and a
                moment of pride and fulfilment for their families and loved ones. This year’s Degree Award Function was
                held at LA 001 and saw the participation of over a hundred attendees, including graduating students,
                faculty, and guests.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2 mt-4">A Day of Celebration and Remembrance</h2>
            <p>
                The event began on a solemn note, with the gathering observing a minute of silence in memory of Prakash
                Chandra Nayak, who was to receive his M.Sc. degree in Mathematics posthumously.
            </p>
            <p>
                The guest of honour for the occasion was Professor B. V. Rao, an eminent probabilist from the Chennai
                Mathematical Institute. Having delivered an engaging lecture on Markov Chains the previous day,
                Professor Rao’s presence was received with great enthusiasm by both students and faculty. Many
                graduating students took the opportunity to interact with him, making it one of the most memorable
                moments of the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the welcome address, the Departmental Teaching Award was presented to Professor Suresh Kumar
                in recognition of his outstanding contributions to teaching. The ceremony continued with the
                distribution of academic awards to the top-performing students of the graduating batches, leading up to
                the highlight of the afternoon, the Degree Award Function itself. Proud smiles, photographs, and
                emotional farewells filled the auditorium as graduates took to the stage. The programme concluded with
                short addresses by graduating students, a final photo session, and an informal gathering over tea and
                refreshments.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2 mt-4">Reflections from the Graduating Batch</h2>
            <p>
                As the graduating B.S. and M.Sc. students set forth on new journeys, many shared thoughtful reflections on
                their time in the department. Their paths ahead include doctoral studies, teaching positions, and
                careers in finance, management, data science, and software engineering.

            <p>
                Several students spoke appreciatively of the guidance they received from professors, teaching
                assistants, and peers. Others expressed that certain academic and emotional challenges might have been
                eased through stronger institutional support. The recently introduced regular meetings between students
                and faculty advisors were widely regarded as a step in the right direction, helping strengthen
                communication and mentorship across batches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graduates also highlighted the growing recognition of statistics and interdisciplinary interests within
                the department. Some felt that additional flexibility in crediting statistics courses towards the
                mathematics degrees would have been beneficial. However, they acknowledged that considerable progress
                has already been made on this front and expressed optimism about the department’s increasing
                responsiveness to students’ academic aspirations.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2 mt-4">Learning Beyond the Classroom</h2>
            <p>
                The graduating students shared words of advice for their juniors, encouraging them to balance academic
                diligence with personal well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                Academically, they emphasised the importance of keeping pace with courses, solving assignments and
                tutorials regularly, and seeking assistance from professors, teaching assistants, and friends when
                necessary. Many attributed their intellectual growth to the department’s rigorous academic environment
                and the spirit of collaboration among peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Equally, they encouraged juniors to participate in sports, technical clubs, and cultural events, noting
                that these activities contribute significantly to personal development. They advised their successors to
                take up positions of responsibility only when genuinely interested, ensuring that their commitments
                remain meaningful and fulfilling.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2 mt-4">Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                As this cohort of students moves on to diverse academic and professional endeavours, their time in the
                Department of Mathematics at IIT Bombay remains a shared experience of growth, perseverance, and
                discovery. For many, it was here that they not only deepened their understanding of mathematics but also
                developed a sense of resilience that will serve them well in the years ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the convocation marks the conclusion of one chapter, it also signifies the beginning of many
                others. The graduates carry forward both the lessons and the spirit of the department, defined by
                curiosity, persistence, and an enduring pursuit of knowledge.
