                Welcome to the Mathematics Association Editorial Team! Now the natural follow-up question to the
                unusually cheery introduction from members of our wonderful department would be, "Who are we"? And frankly,
                there is no trivial response to such a question. There is the philosophical answer, which delves into
                the inner workings of the complex human mind, or there is the mathematical approach, where we proceed
                with structured detail on what we as an entity constitute. However, we will prove through contradiction
                that no simple explanation exists for this question. For if it did, what questions that are left to be
                unanswered would we have reason to overcommunicate to you about? Despite there being no clear answer to
                this problem, we will still attempt to provide some clarity.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are a new unit within the Mathematics Association, responsible for bringing you the brand-new
                Mathematics Department Annual Newsletter! The contents of this newsletter remain a mystery to even the
                editors, but what we wish to impart is a sense of knowledge about the department's happenings, along
                with all that is beautiful and, perhaps, not so beautiful about the academic pursuit of mathematics.
                However, we are no strangers to the motivations of many in this department. We wish to be the voice of
                all those who set foot here, and with what diversity of opportunities (or potential lack thereof) that
                those who leave are met with. We wish to bring voices to them all. So join us on this journey as we
                discover what it means to be part of this department and all the colour it may bring to people’s lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                We bring to you our Department General Secretary, Ujjwal Kumar Mishra. A man of big words and bullet
                point agendas, whenever in need of a conversation to break down the human psychology - he is the one to
                go too. Hyper-organised and pioneer of the department newsletter, he holds a strong belief in all voices
                getting a fair chance to be heard.
            </p>

            <p>
                We bring to you, Sahana Jahagirdar, Chief Editor of the Editorial Board. With her witty remarks and a
                little-too-honest sense of humour, she has promised to ensure her winding stories eventually get to the
                point. Her intensive background in creative writing and pursuit of artistic endeavours serve as a
                blatant side quest from her research pursuits. Her only aim in her tenure is to show that research
                "enthusiasts" can be "fun" too (the precise definition of enthusiasm and acts of enjoyment is left as an
                exercise to the reader).
            </p>

            <h3 class="h3 mt-4">Editor: Nilabha Saha</h3>

            <p>
                We bring to you, Nilabha Saha, an Editor of the Editorial Board, a self-proclaimed crusader against
                typographical sins, and a man whose idea of casual conversation includes debating font aesthetics,
                ranking song bridges by emotional damages, and deeply abstract philosophical dialogues. Known for
                treating LaTeX like a lifestyle choice and cryptography like a personality trait, he brings to the Board
                an alarming combination of precision, dramatic flair, and a habit of writing emails with more narrative
                structure than most novellas. While passionately rephrasing sentences for better dramatic cadence, he
                insists that good writing should be as satisfying as a clean compile and as elegant as a well-balanced
                TikZ diagram. Whether this is merely a snippet of an editorial article or a long-form performance art
                piece is, of course, left to interpretation.

            <p>
                Meet Souhardya Biswas, an Editor of the Editorial Board. A true sports enthusiast with a flair for
                words,
                Souhardya brings energy, curiosity, and a touch of humour to everything he writes. While sports remain
                his favourite playground, he’s always up for exploring new topics and perspectives. With his thoughtful
                take on stories and a sharp editorial eye, he’s all set to make this year’s editions both engaging and
                memorable.
