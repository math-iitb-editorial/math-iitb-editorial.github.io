                <p>
                    Dr. Sutanu Roy is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at IIT Bombay, where he
                    joined the faculty
                    in October 2024 after serving as a faculty member in the School of Mathematical Sciences at the
                    National Institute of
                    Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Originally from Kolkata, Dr. Roy completed his undergraduate studies in mathematics at Scottish
                    Church College,
                    University of Calcutta, and went on to earn an M.Sc. in Mathematics and Computing from the Indian
                    Institute of
                    Technology Guwahati. He then pursued doctoral studies in mathematics at the Georg-August-Universität
                    Göttingen,
                    Germany, where he earned his Dr. rer. nat. degree in 2013 under the supervision of Professor Ralf
                    Meyer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Professor Roy’s research interests centre on quantum groups in the operator-algebraic framework, as
                    well as their
                    interaction with quantum symmetries, which provide a systematic framework for groups and symmetries
                    in the realm of
                    noncommutative geometry.

            <!-- Q&A -->
            <section class="mb-5">

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>What initially drew you to mathematics? Was there a specific moment or influence
                        that shaped your interest?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I can’t pinpoint one single moment that “made” me love mathematics. It wasn’t a lightning bolt, it
                    was gradual, something that evolved over almost a decade, through school and my high school years.
                    There was a time when I liked both physics and mathematics, and it was genuinely hard for me to tell
                    which one I was more inclined towards. They seemed to blur into each other. For a long time, I
                    thought I could pursue either of them. However, eventually, during my 12th grade, I decided to
                    pursue a career in mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had to pinpoint one particular incident that significantly changed how I approached maths, it
                    would be in class 4. Until then, I treated mathematics the same way I treated my other subjects. I
                    memorised everything. I didn’t really understand what I was doing; I just remembered procedures.
                    Then, one fine day, our school had an exam filled with conceptual questions. I was utterly
                    unprepared for that kind of paper and performed disastrously. I still remember the embarrassment.
                    But that failure turned out to be a huge eye-opener. I realised that mathematics doesn’t reward
                    memorisation; it rewards understanding. So I consciously changed how I studied. I stopped rote
                    learning and started asking “Why?” instead of just “How?” Within a few months, the change was
                    reflected in my marks, with the next exam going exceptionally well. It was the first time I could
                    see that understanding something deeply was actually more powerful than merely memorising it
                    mechanically. That small incident made a big difference. I began to enjoy mathematics for its logic,
                    its clarity, and its sense of cause and effect. And, of course, I owe a great deal to my teachers,
                    one of my uncles, and my parents, who constantly encouraged me. So, it wasn’t a one-day decision. It
                    was a long process shaped by many people and experiences, all of which led me toward mathematics.
                </p>

                <div class="my-4"></div>

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Did you always envision yourself in academia, or were there alternate paths you
                        considered?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I never imagined doing anything outside academia. Not seriously, at least. From the time I
                    was a student, my goals were always simple and short-term, almost naïve, in retrospect. When I was
                    in college, I wanted to be a teacher at a school. During my master’s program, I aspired to teach at
                    a college. And when I was pursuing my PhD, my dream was to join a university as a faculty member. My
                    goals evolved naturally with each stage of my academic
                    journey, but they never strayed outside the classroom or the realm of academia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a brief moment during my postdoctoral research in Canada, near the end of my post-doctoral
                    fellowship, and before my first job in India, when I began thinking about the industry. But it was
                    not a serious plan. It was more of an idle curiosity, a thought like, “Maybe I should explore what’s
                    out there.” It lasted a few weeks, maybe months, but deep down, I knew I wouldn’t actually leave
                    academia. So, in that sense, yes, academia was always the plan. I never had an alternative path laid
                    out, which is not the most practical approach, I’ll admit. But that was how I functioned.
                </p>

                <div class="my-4"></div>

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Is there a reason you never considered anything outside academia?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Partly, it’s because I never had that exposure. Growing up, nobody around me worked in the corporate
                    or industrial side of things, so I didn’t have much of a sense of what that life would look like.
                    But more importantly, I was, and still am, deeply committed to the idea of mathematics as a lifelong
                    pursuit. One of my teachers had once said something that really stayed with me: “If you decide to
                    pursue a career in mathematics, then even if you end up in a humble position, you shouldn’t regret
                    that choice.” The idea was that your satisfaction should come from the work itself, not from where
                    it takes you. It’s not always a practical way to think, but I somehow took it to heart. So even if,
                    in the worst-case scenario, I hadn’t landed an academic job, I think I’d still have stayed in the
                    same world, maybe teaching informally. I had a very extreme, almost idealistic view of the
                    profession. For better or worse, I’ve always followed that line of thought.
                </p>

                <hr class="my-4">

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>What keeps you motivated to pursue research and teaching after so many
                        years?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    For me, teaching is a source of energy. Every time I teach a course, even if it’s one I’ve taught
                    multiple times, I prepare from scratch. I don’t recycle old notes because each time, I’m a slightly
                    different person with a bit more experience and perspective. That difference changes how I see the
                    subject. When I revisit a theorem after a few years, I often find that it offers a new perspective.
                    Perhaps a proof now feels simpler, or maybe I’ve noticed a subtlety I overlooked before. I also like
                    exploring different textbooks. Each author has their own way of presenting an idea, and that variety
                    keeps things fresh. Sometimes I find a new proof in a book and think, “Oh, this is such a beautiful
                    way to see it.” Those small discoveries keep me excited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interacting with students is another joy. Although students nowadays are sometimes less vocal in
                    class, the few who ask questions often prompt me to rethink how I explain things. And occasionally,
                    I learn something from them: new perspectives and new ways to communicate or to simplify an idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for research, it’s slower but equally fulfilling. You rarely achieve significant results quickly;
                    sometimes, even proving a lemma can take weeks. It’s a long, continuous process. The key is to
                    continually learn new techniques and stay up-to-date with developments in your field. For me,
                    teaching and research complement each other beautifully. When I feel stuck in research, I dive into
                    teaching. When I make progress in research, I ride that momentum. It’s a self-sustaining cycle with
                    one fuelling the other.
                </p>

                <div class="my-4"></div>

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>What does a day in the life of a researcher actually look like?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    That depends a lot on the person. Some people have a very regimented schedule: they start at nine,
                    take coffee breaks, read for specific hours, go jogging at five, and so on. I’ve never been able to
                    work that way. In my experience, research is far more unpredictable. You might spend an entire day
                    reading one paper and realise by evening that it doesn’t help you. Or you could sit down casually
                    one morning and suddenly find an argument that keeps you up all night. During my PhD, my days had
                    this uneven rhythm. There were periods of intense energy followed by stretches of frustration. You
                    start out excited, thinking your problem is new and untouched, only to discover that people have
                    been aware of parts of it for decades. That realisation can be disheartening. But it’s also part of
                    the process and teaches you humility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having a good doctoral mentor helps tremendously. They’ve already experienced those emotional swings
                    and can tell you whether your approach is likely to be effective. Sometimes, just hearing “Yes, this
                    is a good direction” can save you months of doubt. In theoretical research, you don't get tangible
                    results every day. It's a virtual experiment with unseen progress. Most of the time, your output is
                    invisible; it lives in the structure of your thoughts, not on a screen or graph. But when a proof
                    finally clicks, when you write the last line of something that’s been haunting you for months,
                    that’s one of the best feelings in the world. It may only last for a day or two, but it’s enough to
                    keep you going.
                </p>

                <hr class="my-4">

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Can you recall a breakthrough moment that reaffirmed your decision to stay in
                        academia?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Yes, vividly. It was during the final year of my PhD in Göttingen, just before Christmas. My
                    supervisor had told me that I could start writing my thesis, which was reassuring, but there was one
                    problem I had been unable to solve for over a year. Then Christmas came, and Göttingen emptied out.
                    It’s a small university town, and during the holidays, everything shuts down. My building, which
                    usually housed around fifty inhabitants, had only two or three of us left. It was eerily quiet,
                    almost haunting, but also peaceful. One fine night, with no distractions, I sat down to work on that
                    problem again. Over the course of three days, I managed to close the gaps, fill in all the missing
                    arguments, and prove the result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That short burst of progress became one of the chapters of my thesis. What made it special was not
                    just the result but the timing. I had been on the verge of losing confidence in myself, wondering if
                    I was cut out for research at all. Solving it reminded me why I was here. Ironically, within a few
                    weeks, the excitement faded, and I began to see the result as “obvious”. That’s how research works.
                    Your big victories shrink in hindsight.
                </p>

                <div class="my-4"></div>

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>How do you see the balance between collaboration and individuality in
                        research, and how has collaboration worked for you?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I’ve been fortunate to have very positive experiences with collaboration. For me, a good
                    collaboration begins with mutual respect and complementary strengths. The best projects I’ve worked
                    on have been with people who knew something I didn’t and vice versa. It’s not about dividing a
                    problem mechanically, such as “you do part A, I’ll do part B”. It’s about bringing two different
                    sets of tools to the same goal. Sometimes, my collaborator was faster, sometimes I was. What
                    mattered was trust, because if either of us lost trust in the other during one of their slow
                    patches, the whole collaborative effort would fall to its knees.
                </p>

                <hr class="my-4">

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>How should a student passionate about mathematics choose between academia and
                        industry?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    That’s a profoundly personal decision, and no one else can make it for you. I don’t think professors
                    or mentors should dictate it either; they can advise, not decide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, you have to be honest with yourself. Research is not a short-term commitment; it can easily
                    shape the next ten years of your life. You need to ask yourself, “How good am I at handling
                    uncertainty? Can I work through frustration without visible rewards?” Because in research, failure
                    is routine, and success is slow. The other reality is that in academia, you spend a lot of time
                    thinking about things that very few people around you understand. So your frustrations are often
                    hard to share. Your family may sympathise, but they won’t grasp what’s wrong. You learn to live with
                    that solitude. On the other hand, if you find joy in the process itself and if the act of thinking,
                    learning, and inching forward feels rewarding, then research is worth it. There’s no absolute right
                    or wrong path. The important thing is to decide knowingly, not by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is better to talk to someone who is already in industry to help decide whether you'll find
                    yourself to a better fit there.
                </p>

                <div class="my-4"></div>

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>What are the biggest misconceptions students usually have about research in
                        mathematics?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    One big misconception is that mathematics is uniquely difficult, and that not being good at it is
                    somehow “normal”. People even say it proudly that “I’m terrible at maths.” You wouldn’t usually hear
                    that about other subjects, but with maths, people sometimes boast about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among students who do want to pursue maths, the common misconception is about what progress looks
                    like. In mathematics, progress is rarely visible. You can’t see it the way you see a structure
                    taking shape on a construction site. In research, you’re also building something - an idea or a
                    proof - but it lives entirely in your head until it’s complete. Because of that, many students fail
                    to recognise small successes. They think only in terms of final theorems, not the gradual learning
                    that leads there. But research requires you to notice and celebrate the quieter wins: understanding
                    a tough paper, finding a new way to restate a lemma, or discovering a counterexample that clarifies
                    your path. The output in mathematics is often invisible but deeply meaningful if you learn to see
                    it.
                </p>

                <div class="my-4"></div>

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>What advice would you give to students who feel intimidated or fear they
                        might not be good enough for research?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, the phrase “good enough” is misleading. In a course, your ability is judged by a snapshot:
                    one day, one paper, one problem set. Research doesn’t work that way. It’s about persistence and
                    self-direction. When you start a PhD, treat it as your job. Your supervisor is there to guide you,
                    not to do the thinking for you. You’ll have long stretches where no one is telling you what to do,
                    and that’s part of the training. It teaches independence.

                    The transition from coursework to research is like shifting from learning recipes to inventing your
                    own dishes. You know the ingredients, but you have to decide what to make with them. It can be
                    daunting, but if you keep asking questions, reading, discussing, and thinking on your own, you
                    slowly get the rhythm of it. Also, avoid constantly comparing yourself to others, as research is a
                    nonlinear process. Some people solve big problems in a year, some take five. Consistency and
                    curiosity is what drives one through research!

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>What qualities are essential for someone considering a career in pure
                        mathematics?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    You must enjoy solving problems; that’s the heart of it. Every textbook you read gives you a handful
                    of exercises; don’t skip them. Try to solve at least a few. Until you’ve struggled through problems
                    on your own, your understanding remains abstract. When you solve problems, push them further: drop a
                    hypothesis, change an assumption, see what fails. Sometimes, that process leads you to completely
                    new questions. It’s how many good research ideas begin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another essential quality is curiosity, along with a constant urge to ask questions. Don’t hesitate
                    to ask “stupid” questions; they’re often the ones that reveal the deepest gaps in understanding. I
                    wish I’d realised that sooner. In pure maths, proposing a question can be as valuable as answering
                    one. You often discover that to answer a question properly, you need to invent new definitions or
                    frameworks. Finding the right definition is an art; sometimes it’s the backbone of a research
                    article.

                <hr class="my-4">

                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Looking back, is there something you wish you had known as a student or
                        early-career academic?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Plenty. For one, I wish I had asked more questions in class. I used to be shy about speaking up,
                    afraid of asking something trivial. That was a mistake. The classroom is the safest place to be
                    wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wish I had studied more broadly during my PhD, rather than narrowing down too early. I should
                    have attended more seminars and workshops. Your PhD is the last period in life when you can devote
                    almost all your time to learning. After that, jobs, grants, and responsibilities take over. My
                    supervisor encouraged me to explore other topics, and I didn’t listen as much as I should have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, I wish I had realised how much you can gain by simply paying attention in class. If you
                    stay fully engaged during lectures, you save hours later. I was fortunate to have had wonderful
                    teachers at every stage, from school to college to my PhD. If I could redo those years, I’d make the
                    most of every single lecture. As a faculty member, I now understand how challenging it is to find
                    time to learn something new from scratch. The patience and energy you have as a student are the best
                    resources you’ll ever have. Use it well.
